                <p>I started my journey in the world of computers from an young age.<br></br>

     I followed a training by<a href="https://becode.org"> BeCode.org.</a><br></br>
      Web development is become my center of interest, I love the idea of cross-platform development.
      Discovering a lot of different languages and frameworks to create an app and play with code.<br></br>
I also like creating Interactive UI components for better UX  and share those design and codes
to the world through Github and more.
